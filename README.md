## 🚢 Deploy to Railway

### Prerequisites
- [Railway account](https://railway.app)
- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) or GitHub integration

### Steps

1. **Clone and push to GitHub**
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd taskflow
git push origin main
```

2. **Create Railway project**
   - Go to [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Railway auto-detects the `railway.toml`

3. **Set environment variables** in Railway dashboard:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-string
NODE_ENV=production
DB_PATH=/app/data/taskflow.db
```

4. **Add a volume** (for SQLite persistence):
   - In Railway: go to your service → Volumes
   - Mount path: `/app/data`

5. **Deploy** — Railway builds and starts automatically

### Default Admin
The app creates a default admin on first run:
- **Email**: `admin@taskflow.com`  
- **Password**: `Admin@123`

> ⚠️ Change the admin password immediately after first login!
